// Write a function called fizzBuzz that will do the following:
// 1) Go through the numbers 1-100
// 2) If the number is a multiple of 3 print fizz
// 3) If the number is a multiple of 5 print buzz
// 4) If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 print fizzBuzz
// 5) If the number doesnt match any of the above then simply print the number



// ***Bonus***
// Write a function called fizzBuzz2 that does the above, but instead of hardcoded
// numbers pass them as parameters. ex: fizzBuzz2(500, 2, 9)



// ***Super Bonus***
// Write a function called fizzBuzz3 that does the same as the bonus above, but recursivly.
// Hint: you might need a counter variable starting at 1!
